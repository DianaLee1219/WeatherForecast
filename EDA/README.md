# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## How it works?
* It performs EDA to uncover the trends, correlations, and patterns. Including visualizations for temperature and precipitation.

This is the correlation heatmap showing correlation between all the numerical data in the dataset.
* Positive correlation
  * 'Temperature' was stronlgy correlated with 'feels like temperater'(0.97) and was moderately correlated with 'UV index' (0.49), which is moderately related with 'feels like temperater'(0.40). 
* Negative correlation
  * 'Humidity' was moderately related to 'UV index' (-0.57) and 'air quality (Ozone)' (-0.5).
  * 'Air quality (NO2)' was moderately related to 'temperature' (-0.43) and 'feels like temperater'(-0.42).
